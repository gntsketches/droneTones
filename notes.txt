TODO
    - test & post re: crackle tester
        or at least just ask about if I'm doing .dispose() right
    - how to adjust base pitch - detune in sequence?
    - equalize PartialBuilder volume by basing it on partials.length
    - PartialBuilder types
        clusters
        modulo
        one/two/three etc. notes
	- id params for each effect
    waiting for: Envelope 'Release' property does not accept '8n' string. #501 https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/501
        "you can try using Tone.Time('8n') or Tone.Time('8n').toSeconds() as a work-around for now"

UI / ADJUSTABLE
    BasePitch
    Rests
    Pattern (detunings)
    "Tempo" (loop rate)
    *Drift (time, pitchSet)
