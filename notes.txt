    think twice Ralph Myerz & The Jack Herren Band
    add 'rest' case
    remove 'speed' and add rise, fall, rest controls
    hook up effects options inputs
    refine the partials options
    switch the interval selectors to note selectors & make the root pitch options to modulate-by-interval
    review the styles and all the code in general
    put it up live
    get feedback

DETAILS
    stop pitches more quickly?
    css kerning?

    why did adding a container div to the select allow it to reach the specified (7vh - observed relative to the tuning divs) properly?

BETTER "make it sound better"
        compression?
        manging the psychology of cRaCKlE
            https://codepen.io/gntsketches/pen/zgmmQW
        equalize volumes
            equalize PartialBuilder volume by basing it on partials.length?
        investigate the nature of volume and gain

MAYBE
	? hide elements prior to initialization
	? use Bootstrap or something, like to make a pretty range slider
    ?     Shows shifting synths in the DOM with highlighting or synth names ... getting into jQ territory with some of this

"FINAL" CLEANUP
    change "options" naming in main page
    intervalAdd etc. to add synth, both in CSS & JS
    comb other css conventions
    find css which can be "shared".
    review various units, etc.
    naming conventions everywhere
    refactor - consider changeEffectSettings vs other types of state mod functions and their relation to naming conventions in DOM
    _toggleFilter and others which use changeEffectSettings could be done with an array and a forEach...
    ? "Options" page can become "Synths" for New Synthesizer Options


STYLE MINUTIA
    Border radius on phone-landscape...


ALTERNATE VERSION
    all synths fire at once (or timeout to start)
    rather than speed, there is a max and min timing for the attack/release
        min/max attack/release â€“ one option for attack release or different for each
    once a synth volume goes to zero, it gets a new synthOptions setup
    the select elements representing the synths glow and fade with the volume!
        do you need jQ? can you do that on your own?
            https://codepen.io/WebIsm/pen/pvVrgj
        can you do this with just css animation?
            https://css-tricks.com/controlling-css-animations-transitions-javascript/
                https://codepen.io/gntsketches/pen/KOGGYa
    synth trigger options:
        choose between synths playing randomly or firing in order (?)
        random option - different attack release each time? or, synths in steady pulse rhythm - maybe change by increment
    HOW?

    Dude, you're not disposing of the Chorus, Vibrato, or Gain...

FUTURE
    UI / ADJUSTABLE
	    hamburger menu w: about, synth type select, pattern select, effects select
    - user picks which synth types
    - user picks pattern?
        drop-down list with a bunch of patterns
        rests?
        (example options: sub, main, interval, rest... remove, add...)
    - visualization window? (would be awesome with waveforms...)
    - user sets effects params
    - volume
    - https://propa.app/
	- picker wheel: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33157307/how-to-make-a-html5-spinning-list-rotating-wheel-selector-picker
    - Drift (time, pitchSet)
    - more complicated (chord/polyphony) options for pitches
    - Logo! (picture of waves interacting)

    can SynthBuilder accept an object for testing?

    re: chosenSynthOptions:
        OR use a do-while loop to randomly select true values from _activeSynthOptions with Object.keys?
        OR use .filter()
            const chosenSynthOptions = Object.keys(synthOptions)
            .filter(synthName => synthOptions[synthName] === true) // can reference array as argument


STUDY
    *** architecture questions ***
    accessing something by "going in from Global", eg: DroneTones.synthParams.envelopeSettings

    why: if you don'have the default (Main) page wrapper div first instead of last, you can scroll up (but not) down from Options and About
    Loop not called without TriggerAttackRelease: https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/500
