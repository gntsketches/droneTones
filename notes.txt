    Dude, you're not disposing of the Chorus, Vibrato, or Gain...

FUTURE
    UI / ADJUSTABLE
	    hamburger menu w: about, synth type select, pattern select, effects select
    - user picks which synth types
    - user picks pattern?
        drop-down list with a bunch of patterns
        rests?
        (example options: sub, main, interval, rest... remove, add...)
    - visualization window? (would be awesome with waveforms...)
    - user sets effects params
    - volume
    - https://propa.app/
	- picker wheel: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33157307/how-to-make-a-html5-spinning-list-rotating-wheel-selector-picker
    - Drift (time, pitchSet)
    - more complicated (chord/polyphony) options for pitches
    - Logo! (picture of waves interacting)
