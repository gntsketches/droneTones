    merge
    mvc it
    get feedback
    put it up live
    ? "quick stop" checkbox (could add to UI next to a volume control)


DETAILS
    css kerning?
    https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/outside-in-ordering-css-properties-by-importance--cms-21685
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1696864/naming-class-and-id-html-attributes-dashes-vs-underlines
    Border radius on phone-landscape...


"FINAL" CLEANUP
    not a lot of consistency in terms of width / horizontal padding or margin...
    labeling: why not accessibility?
    change "options" naming in main page
    intervalAdd etc. to add synth, both in CSS & JS
    comb other css conventions
    find css which can be "shared".
    review various units, etc.
    naming conventions everywhere
    refactor - consider changeEffectSettings vs other types of state mod functions and their relation to naming conventions in DOM
    _toggleFilter and others which use changeEffectSettings could be done with an array and a forEach...
    ? "Options" page can become "Synths" for New Synthesizer Options




FUTURE PLAN
    Study design patterns to develop some sort of framework
    Which seems like it would be needed to manage:
        persistence of app state via local storage (and a 'reset to defaults' option)

MAYBE/SOMEDAY/IDEAS
	? hide elements prior to initialization
	? use Bootstrap or something, like to make a pretty range slider
    ? pick specific pitches rather than intervals, then option to adjust everything by interval
    ? visualization window? (would be awesome with waveforms...)
    ? volume
	? picker wheel: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33157307/how-to-make-a-html5-spinning-list-rotating-wheel-selector-picker
    ? Drift (time, pitchSet)
        ? more complicated (chord/polyphony) options for pitches
    ? Logo! (picture of waves interacting)


STUDY
    *** architecture questions ***
    is it bad to access something by "going in from Global", eg: DroneTones.constants.whatever

    why: if you don'have the default (Main) page wrapper div first instead of last, you can scroll up (but not) down from Options and About
    Loop not called without TriggerAttackRelease: https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/500

    why are arrow functions not working on DroneTone object?

        https://dmitripavlutin.com/when-not-to-use-arrow-functions-in-javascript/

    why did adding a container div to the select allow it to reach the specified (7vh - observed relative to the tuning divs) properly?

CODE ALTERNATIVES
    re: chosenSynthOptions:
        OR use a do-while loop to randomly select true values from _activeSynthOptions with Object.keys?
        OR use .filter()
            const chosenSynthOptions = Object.keys(synthOptions)
            .filter(synthName => synthOptions[synthName] === true) // can reference array as argument
