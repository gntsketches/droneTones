- can SynthBuilder accept an object for testing?
- Loop not called without TriggerAttackRelease: https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/500

PARKING LOT
    - user picks which synth types
    - user picks pattern?
        drop-down list with a bunch of patterns
        rests?
        (example options: sub, main, interval, rest... remove, add...)
    - visualization window? (would be awesome with waveforms...)
    - user sets effects params
    - volume

    - more complicated (chord/polyphony) options for pitches
