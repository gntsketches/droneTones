    Test effect settings
        clean up
        clean up names: intervalAdd etc. to add synth
        finish caching the dom...: 	this._startStopButton = document.querySelector('#start_stop')
        Interval interface:
            seems to need refactoring... vis-a-vis init functions
            seems like the confusion is about whether an item is in the HTML originally or added with JS
        "Options" page can become "Synths" for New Synthesizer Options (

    if (not only one synth) ...
    hitting space bar to start/stop vs  checkboxes
        continue to cache the DOM
    what if user changes checked items before pressing play?
        build the synths array when play is pressed
    CSS
        why did adding a container div to the select allow it to reach the specified (7vh - observed relative to the tuning divs) properly?
       clean
            find css which can be "shared".
            review various units, etc.

	    align selects & tuners & range slider
	"make it sound better"
	    with that long timeout maybe you can have a longer release tail? (and correlate the timeout with the BPM...)
        hook attack & release to tempo
            "you can try using Tone.Time('8n') or Tone.Time('8n').toSeconds() as a work-around for now"
        "smoother"?
        equalize volumes
            equalize PartialBuilder volume by basing it on partials.length?
            compression?
        investigate the nature of volume and gain
        rapid fade with stop
	? hide elements prior to initialization
	? use Bootstrap or something, like to make a pretty range slider
    ?     Shows shifting synths in the DOM with highlighting or synth names ... getting into jQ territory with some of this
    Final Cleanup
        naming conventions everywhere
        refactor - consider changeEffectSettings vs other types of state mod functions and their relation to naming conventions in DOM
        _toggleFilter and others which use changeEffectSettings could be done with an array and a forEach...
    waiting for:
        Envelope 'Release' property does not accept '8n' string. #501 https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/501
            "you can try using Tone.Time('8n') or Tone.Time('8n').toSeconds() as a work-around for now"



ALTERNATE VERSION
    all synths fire at once (or timeout to start)
    rather than speed, there is a max and min timing for the ASDR
    once a synth volume goes to zero, it gets a new synthOptions setup
    the select elements representing the synths glow and fade with the volume!
        do you need jQ? can you do that on your own?
        can you do this with just css animation?

    Dude, you're not disposing of the Chorus, Vibrato, or Gain...

FUTURE
    UI / ADJUSTABLE
	    hamburger menu w: about, synth type select, pattern select, effects select
    - user picks which synth types
    - user picks pattern?
        drop-down list with a bunch of patterns
        rests?
        (example options: sub, main, interval, rest... remove, add...)
    - visualization window? (would be awesome with waveforms...)
    - user sets effects params
    - volume
    - https://propa.app/
	- picker wheel: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33157307/how-to-make-a-html5-spinning-list-rotating-wheel-selector-picker
    - Drift (time, pitchSet)
    - more complicated (chord/polyphony) options for pitches
    - Logo! (picture of waves interacting)

    can SynthBuilder accept an object for testing?

STUDY
    *** architecture questions ***
    accessing something by "going in from Global", eg: DroneTones.synthParams.envelopeSettings

    why: if you don'have the default (Main) page wrapper div first instead of last, you can scroll up (but not) down from Options and About
    Loop not called without TriggerAttackRelease: https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/500
