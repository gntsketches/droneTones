    clean up
        adjust synth gain to proper synth count
        clean up names: intervalAdd etc. to add synth
        finish caching the dom...: 	this._startStopButton = document.querySelector('#start_stop')
        Interval interface:
            seems to need refactoring... vis-a-vis init functions
            seems like the confusion is about whether an item is in the HTML originally or added with JS
        "Options" page can become "Synths" for New Synthesizer Options (
    boolean/checkbox for chorus, vibrato, other effects
    make some better partial builders
        Sawtooth
        FullStops - range
        RandomStops - range

    if (not only one synth) ...
    hitting space bar to start/stop vs  checkboxes
        continue to cache the DOM
    what if user changes checked items before pressing play?
        build the synths array when play is pressed
    Shows shifting synths in the DOM with highlighting or synth names ... getting into jQ territory with some of this
    CSS
        why did adding a container div to the select allow it to reach the specified (7vh - observed relative to the tuning divs) properly?

	    align selects & tuners & range slider
	"make it sound better"
	    with that long timeout maybe you can have a longer release tail? (and correlate the timeout with the BPM...)
        hook attack & release to tempo

        equalize volumes
            equalize PartialBuilder volume by basing it on partials.length?

            clusters
            modulo

        investigate the nature of volume and gain
        rapid fade with stop
	id params for each effect
	? hide elements prior to initialization
	? use Bootstrap or something, like to make a pretty range slider

    Dude, you're not disposing of the Chorus, Vibrato, or Gain...

FUTURE
    UI / ADJUSTABLE
	    hamburger menu w: about, synth type select, pattern select, effects select
    - user picks which synth types
    - user picks pattern?
        drop-down list with a bunch of patterns
        rests?
        (example options: sub, main, interval, rest... remove, add...)
    - visualization window? (would be awesome with waveforms...)
    - user sets effects params
    - volume
    - https://propa.app/
	- picker wheel: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33157307/how-to-make-a-html5-spinning-list-rotating-wheel-selector-picker
    - Drift (time, pitchSet)
    - more complicated (chord/polyphony) options for pitches
    - Logo! (picture of waves interacting)

STUDY
    *** architecture questions ***
    accessing something by "going in from Global", eg: DroneTones.synthParams.envelopeSettings

    why: if you don'have the default (Main) page wrapper div first instead of last, you can scroll up (but not) down from Options and About
