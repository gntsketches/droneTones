TODO
    delete synthParams & partialBuilder
    CSS
	    more flexbox
	    responsive
	    align selects & tuners & range slider
	"make it sound better"
        investigate why synth entrance sometimes 'pops'
        hook attack & release to tempo
        "you can try using Tone.Time('8n') or Tone.Time('8n').toSeconds() as a work-around for now"
        equalize volumes
            equalize PartialBuilder volume by basing it on partials.length?
        PartialBuilder types
            clusters
            modulo
            one/two/three etc. notes
        investigate the nature of volume and gain
        rapid fade with stop
	id params for each effect
	? hide elements prior to initialization
	? use Bootstrap or something, like to make a pretty range slider
    waiting for:
        Envelope 'Release' property does not accept '8n' string. #501 https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/501
            "you can try using Tone.Time('8n') or Tone.Time('8n').toSeconds() as a work-around for now"

TODO REFACTOR
	more DOM caching



WAITING FOR
    test & post re: crackle tester
        or at least just ask about if I'm doing .dispose() right

FUTURE
    UI / ADJUSTABLE
	    hamburger menu w: about, synth type select, pattern select, effects select
    - user picks which synth types
    - user picks pattern?
        drop-down list with a bunch of patterns
        rests?
        (example options: sub, main, interval, rest... remove, add...)
    - visualization window? (would be awesome with waveforms...)
    - user sets effects params
    - volume
    - https://propa.app/
	- picker wheel: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33157307/how-to-make-a-html5-spinning-list-rotating-wheel-selector-picker
    - Drift (time, pitchSet)
    - more complicated (chord/polyphony) options for pitches
    - Logo! (picture of waves interacting)

    can SynthBuilder accept an object for testing?
